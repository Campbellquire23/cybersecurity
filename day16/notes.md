# Day 16 – PATH environment variable

## Linux practice
- Used `echo $PATH` to view directories where Linux looks for executables.
- Redirected the output into `path.txt`.
- Verified with `cat` and exported for GitHub.

## Commands learned
- `echo $PATH` → prints the PATH variable (list of directories searched for commands).
- `>` → saves command output to a file.
- `cat file` → displays the file contents.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 2, Module 2** (≈45–60 min today).
