# Day 2 – Simple Shell Script

## Linux Practice
- Created a script (`hello_day2.sh`) that prints:
  - The current user (`whoami`)
  - The current directory (`pwd`)
  - The date (`date`)
- Made the script executable with `chmod +x`.
- Ran the script and captured its output to `output.txt` using `tee`.

## Commands Learned
- `#!/bin/sh` → shebang, tells Linux how to run the script.
- `$(command)` → command substitution (runs the command inside and inserts the result).
- `chmod +x file` → makes a script executable.
- `./file` → runs a script from the current directory.
- `| tee file` → shows output and saves it at the same time.

## Google Cybersecurity Certificate
- Spent ~45–60 min on **Course 2, Module 2** today.
- Continuing daily progress on the cert alongside Linux practice.
