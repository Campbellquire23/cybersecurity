# Day 4 – Find + Word Count Practice

## Linux practice
- Created three files (`a.txt`, `b.txt`, `c.log`).
- Used `find . -type f -name "*.txt"` to locate `.txt` files.
- Saved the list into `txt_files.txt`.
- Counted words with `wc -w *.txt` and saved results into `word_counts.txt`.

## Commands learned
- `find . -type f -name "*.txt"` → list all `.txt` files in the current folder.
- `wc -w file` → word count for a file.
- `>` → overwrite/create a file with output.
- `cat file` → show a file’s contents.
