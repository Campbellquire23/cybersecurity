# Day 9 – cut command with CSV fields

## Linux practice
- Created `people.csv` with sample name/age/city data.
- Used `cut -d "," -f 1` to extract the first column (names) → `names.txt`.
- Used `cut -d "," -f 3` to extract the third column (cities) → `cities.txt`.

## Commands learned
- `cut` → extracts sections of each line in a file.
- `-d ","` → sets the delimiter to a comma.
- `-f N` → selects the Nth field.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 2, Module 2** (≈45–60 min today).
