# Day 28 – uptime command practice

## Linux practice
- Used `uptime` to display how long the system has been running.
- Redirected the output into `uptime.txt`.
- Verified with `cat` and exported to GitHub.

## Commands learned
- `uptime` → shows running time, users, and load average.
- `>` → saves output into a file.
- `cat file` → displays the file contents.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 5, Module 2** (≈45–60 min today).
