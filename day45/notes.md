# Day 45 – grep -i command practice

## Linux practice
- Created a sample log file with mixed-case “failed” entries.
- Used `grep -ci` to count all failed login attempts, ignoring case.
- Saved output to `failed_count_case_insensitive.txt`, verified with `cat`, and exported to GitHub.

## Commands learned
- `grep -i` → search text ignoring case.
- `grep -ci` → count matches ignoring case.
- `cat file` → display file contents.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 5, Module 5** (≈45–60 min today).
