# Day 47 – grep + wc -l combo practice

## Linux practice
- Created a sample log file with multiple success/failed entries.
- Combined `grep` and `wc -l` using a pipe to count only failed logins.
- Saved output to `failed_count_combined.txt`, verified with `cat`, and exported to GitHub.

## Commands learned
- `|` → pipe, sends output of one command into another.
- `grep "text"` → finds matching lines.
- `wc -l` → counts number of lines.
- `grep text file | wc -l` → count matching lines efficiently.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 5, Module 5** (≈45–60 min today).
