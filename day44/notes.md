# Day 44 – grep -c command practice

## Linux practice
- Created a sample log file with success/failed login attempts.
- Used `grep -c` to count how many lines contained "failed".
- Saved the count to `failed_count.txt`, verified with `cat`, and exported to GitHub.

## Commands learned
- `echo -e` → write multiple lines into a file.
- `grep -c "text" file` → count how many lines contain the text.
- `cat file` → display file contents.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 5, Module 5** (≈45–60 min today).
