# Day 8 – sort + uniq practice

## Linux practice
- Created `animals.txt` with duplicate words.
- Used `sort` to alphabetize lines → `sorted.txt`.
- Used `uniq -c` to count duplicates → `counts.txt`.
- *Tried `unique.txt` but file didn’t export — will retry later if needed.*

## Commands learned
- `sort file` → alphabetically sorts lines in a file.
- `uniq file` → removes duplicate lines (needs sorted input).
- `uniq -c file` → shows duplicates with counts.
- `>` → overwrite/create file with output.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 2, Module 2** (≈45–60 min today).
