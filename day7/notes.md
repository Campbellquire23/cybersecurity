# Day 7 – grep with line numbers

## Linux practice
- Created `log.txt` with sample log entries.
- Searched for “error” messages using `grep -n`.
- Saved results (with line numbers) into `errors.txt`.

## Commands learned
- `grep "word" file` → search for lines containing a word.
- `grep -n` → include line numbers in the results.
- `>` → write output to a new file.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 2, Module 2** (≈45–60 min today).
