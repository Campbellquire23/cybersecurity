# Day 54 – grep -r recursive search

## Linux practice
- Used `grep -r` to search inside multiple files and subdirectories.
- Practiced case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches.
- Saved results to `day54_summary.txt`.

## Commands learned
- `grep -r "text" path` → search all files under a directory.
- `grep -ri "text" path` → same, but case-insensitive.
- Great for finding errors, IPs, or suspicious patterns in logs.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 5, Module 5** (≈45–60 min today)
