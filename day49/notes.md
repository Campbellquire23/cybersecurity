# Day 49 – sort + uniq -c command practice

## Linux practice
- Created a sample log file with repeated login events.
- Used `sort` and `uniq -c` to count how many times each entry occurred.
- Saved output to `login_attempt_counts.txt`, verified with `cat`, and exported to GitHub.

## Commands learned
- `sort file` → sorts lines alphabetically.
- `uniq -c` → removes duplicates and prefixes each unique line with its count.
- `sort file | uniq -c` → powerful combo to count occurrences in logs.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 5, Module 5** (≈45–60 min today).
