# Day 52 – df and du command practice

## Linux practice
- Used `df -h` to view overall disk space.
- Used `du -h --max-depth=1` to measure each folder’s size.
- Combined both results into a single summary file.

## Commands learned
- `df -h` → shows total disk space and free space (human-readable).
- `du -h --max-depth=1` → shows directory sizes up to one level deep.
- Useful for spotting full disks or large log directories.
