# Day 3 – Word Count Practice

## Linux Practice
- Created two files (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`) with text.
- Used `wc -l` to count lines.
- Used `wc -w` to count words.
- Combined results into `counts.txt`.

## Commands Learned
- `wc -l file` → counts lines in a file.
- `wc -w file` → counts words in a file.
- `>` overwrites a file.
- `>>` appends to a file.
- `*.txt` → wildcard to match multiple files.
