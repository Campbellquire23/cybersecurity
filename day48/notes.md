# Day 48 – sort + uniq command practice

## Linux practice
- Created a sample log file with repeated login entries.
- Used `sort` to organize the lines, and `uniq` to remove duplicates.
- Saved the result to `unique_entries.txt`, verified with `cat`, and exported to GitHub.

## Commands learned
- `sort file` → sorts lines alphabetically.
- `uniq file` → removes duplicate adjacent lines.
- `sort file | uniq` → shows unique sorted entries.
- Combine with `-c` to count occurrences: `sort file | uniq -c`.

## Cert progress
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate: **Course 5, Module 5** (≈45–60 min today).
