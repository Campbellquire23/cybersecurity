# Day 55 – grep + wc -l error count

## Linux practice
- Searched logs recursively for lines containing "error".
- Counted total matches using `wc -l`.
- Listed all files that had at least one "error".
- Saved everything to `day55_summary.txt`.

## Commands learned
- `grep -ri "word" path` → find lines containing a word.
- `wc -l` → count the number of lines.
- `grep -ril` → list only filenames that contain the word.
- Combined these to quickly summarize log data.
